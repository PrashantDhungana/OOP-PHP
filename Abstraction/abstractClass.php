/*Real life examples:
1.Imagine you are making an application that deals with employeeâ€™s of a company.
you have a class of Human and a child class of Employee,Guest,Connection.
you will have multiple types of humans,
you will never have a human without a type (by type i mean a child class).
this is why you will make the Human class abstract so that you wont be able to make an object of it directly

2.An abstract class of vehicle have a abstract function start_engine.*/
