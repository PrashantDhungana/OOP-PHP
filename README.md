This is the Code for the things we learned on Jan 05. If these things aren't practised then they will remain for a temporary period of time.
So your efforts are must.
But these are just some of the concepts.OOP is much more than that.

Some of the remaining topic that weren't covered are:
Constructor and Destructor,
Static method and static Class,
Interface,
Trait,

Passing a class to a method,
AND MUCH MORE
